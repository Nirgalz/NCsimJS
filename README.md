Attempt to simulate an eco-system where multiple agents must cooperate in order to survive.

Actual features :
- hard coded 'AI' for testing purposes
- map generation with random tiles
- minions generation
- minions can eat, starve to death and gather food
- minions can plant food, the more they are in a tile, the faster they work.

doing:
- implementing wood resource
- implementing a proper time management system

in the possible future :
- various constructions made of wood that require cooperation
- sleep pattern
- various hazards
- more parameters to play with
- implementation of pixi.js or maybe moving to unity
