Attempt to simulate an eco-system where multiple agents must cooperate in order to survive.

Actual features :
- hard coded 'AI' for testing purposes
- map generation with random tiles
- minions generation
- minions can eat, starve to death and gather food
- minions can plant food, the more they are in a tile, the faster they work.
- basic time manager (slower, faster, pause)

doing:
- implementing wood resource
- sleep pattern
- tests with pixi.js

in the possible future :
- various constructions made of wood that require cooperation
- various hazards
- more parameters to play with
- implementation of pixi.js or maybe moving to unity
- interfaces with AI systems
