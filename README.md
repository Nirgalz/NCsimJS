Attempt to simulate an eco-system where multiple agents must cooperate in order to survive.

Actual features :
- hard coded 'AI' for testing purposes
- map generation with random tiles
- minions can eat, starve to death, gather food, and build some constructions and tools
- basic time manager (slower, faster, pause)
- minions have a memory of past visited tiles and a "social circle"
- communication and cooperation between minions to build certain structures

in the possible future :
- various hazards
- more buildings
- switch all the logic server-side and make it interactive : play as a minion with AIs and /or other players
- more parameters to play with
- interfaces with AI systems

libraries :
- pixi.js
