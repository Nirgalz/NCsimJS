Attempt to simulate an eco-system where multiple agents must cooperate in order to survive.

Actual features :
- hard coded 'AI' for testing purposes
- map generation with random tiles
- minions can eat, starve to death, gather food, and build some constructions and tools
- basic time manager (slower, faster, pause)

doing:
- minions memory of visited tiles and other's minions met
- communication and cooperation between minions to build certain structures

in the possible future :
- various constructions made of wood that require cooperation
- various hazards
- more parameters to play with
- interfaces with AI systems

libraries :
- pixi.js
